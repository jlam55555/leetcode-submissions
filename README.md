My solutions for Leetcode problems

## Some lessons learnt
- Always account for base/trivial cases if applicable
- If some data is to be retrieved in constant time, see if it can be cached (e.g., min stack)

## Common themes
- Divide-and-conquer, especially for trees
- Tree traversal techniques: inorder traversal (binary search trees), preorder traversal (not any LC problem encountered yet?), postorder traversal (symmetry, equality), level-order traversal (BFS)

## Some cool algorithms
- Two-pointer problems: sorted arrays, most water problem, Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm
- Randomization: (e.g., 169, majority element): can be used to "guess and check"
- Boyer-Moore majority voting algorithm
- Boyer-Moore string search algorithm
